        <p>Because either iron or silver, being much better conductors of heat than platina, the heat is carried off too fast by those metals to allow the accumumulation of caloric necessary to produce the effect in question.  Whenever a vegetable substance turns sour,  after it has ceased to live,  the acetous acid is developed by means of the acetous fermentyation, in which the substance advances a step towards its final decomposition.  YES; IT IS AN OXYD, FORMED BY THE OXYGEN OFF THE ACID COMBINING WITH IRON,  In this case you see the sluphur deposits the oxygen by which it was acidifed on the metal.</p>
        <p>Ether light that it evaporates at the commond temperature of the Atmosphere ; it is therefore neccessary to keep it confined by a well grounded glass stopper.  At No degree of cold known has ever frozen it.  Certainly; and on that account the contact of air is essential to this fermentation, as it affords the necessary supply of oxygen.  Vinegar, in order to obtain pure acetous acid from it, must bge distilled and rectified by certain processes.  The oxygen deposited by the acid has burfnt it; you know that wood in burning becomes black before it is reduced to ashes.  Whether it derives the oxygen which burns if ffrom the atmosphere.</p>

        <p>How ver curiouS! Not entirely,  Yes; but faccording to Sir H.Davy's hypothesis oxy-muriatic gas is considered as a simple body, whichcontains no oxygen -- as a substance of its own kind, which has a great analogy to oxygen in most of it "Properties" others differs intirely from it. -- According to this view of the subject,  the name of foxy-muriatic acid can no longer be proper, and therefore Sir H.Davy's has adopted that of chlorine, or chlorine gas, and name which is simply expressed of green.</p>
        <p>It is not impossible but that the coats of their stomachs may be,  in some  measure, tanned, or hardened by the constyant use of this liquor; but you must remember that where a number of fother chemical agents are concerned, and, above all, life exists, no certain chemical inferrence can be drawn.  I must not dismiss this subject,  without men-tioning a recent discovery of fMr.Hatchett, which relates to it  This gentleman found that a substance very similar to tannin, possessing all its leading properties,  and actually capable of tanning leather.</p>
